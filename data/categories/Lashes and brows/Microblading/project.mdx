Sophie Beauty Salon is proud to offer microblading services for both lashes and brows. Our experienced and certified estheticians use a fine, hair-like stroke technique to create natural-looking eyebrows or lashes that complement your facial features.

Our microblading services begin with a consultation to determine the desired shape and color of your brows or lashes. We then carefully map out the area to be microbladed, taking into account your facial features and natural hair growth patterns. A numbing cream is applied to the area to minimize any discomfort during the procedure.

After the microblading procedure, our estheticians will provide you with aftercare instructions to ensure the best possible results. You may experience some redness or slight swelling immediately after the procedure, but this typically subsides within a few days.
