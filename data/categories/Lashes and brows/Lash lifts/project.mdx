We are is thrilled to offer lash lift services to enhance the natural beauty of your lashes. Our lash lift service uses a gentle perming solution to curl and lift your lashes, giving you a wide-eyed, youthful look that can last up to 6-8 weeks.

Our experienced and certified lash technicians begin by cleansing your lashes and applying a protective shield to your lower lashes.

Our lash lift service is perfect for those looking to enhance the natural beauty of their lashes without the maintenance or expense of lash extensions. You can wake up every morning with perfectly curled lashes that don't require any additional mascara or curling.

After your lash lift, it is recommended that you avoid getting your lashes wet for the first 24 hours to allow the lift to fully set. You should also avoid rubbing your eyes or using any harsh eye makeup removers. With proper care, your lash lift can last up to 6-8 weeks before needing a touch-up.
