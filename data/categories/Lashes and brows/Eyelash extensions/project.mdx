Sophie Beauty Salon's experienced and certified lash technicians use only the highest quality products and techniques to create a customized look tailored to your individual preferences.

Our eyelash extension service begins with a consultation to discuss the desired length, curl, and thickness of your lashes. We offer a variety of lash materials including mink, silk, and synthetic, as well as various lengths and curl types to achieve your desired look.

During the application process, our lash technician will carefully apply each individual extension to your natural lashes using a medical-grade adhesive. The process is pain-free and relaxing, with most clients even falling asleep during the application process.

Our eyelash extension service is perfect for those looking to enhance the natural beauty of their lashes for a special occasion or for everyday wear. Wake up every morning with perfect lashes that require little to no maintenance.
