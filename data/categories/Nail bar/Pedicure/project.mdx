At Sophie Beauty Salon, our pedicure service is designed to provide you with a relaxing and rejuvenating experience while promoting healthy, beautiful feet. Our experienced nail technicians will pamper your feet, leaving them looking and feeling their best.

Our pedicure service includes a foot soak to soften and prepare the skin for treatment, followed by a nail trimming and shaping to create a smooth, even shape. Cuticle care is provided to create a clean and neat appearance, and a foot exfoliation removes dead skin and calluses from the feet.

We provide a relaxing foot massage to promote circulation and relaxation, and a polish application gives your nails a long-lasting finish. We use high-quality polishes from trusted brands, ensuring a beautiful and lasting result.

At Sophie Beauty Salon, we understand that every client's needs are unique, and we offer a range of additional treatments and services to customize your pedicure experience. Our gel pedicure service provides a longer-lasting finish that resists chipping and peeling, and our specialty pedicures, such as our paraffin wax treatment, provide extra foot care to target specific concerns.

Our salon is committed to providing a clean and hygienic environment for our clients. We use sterilized instruments for each client, and our foot baths are thoroughly disinfected between each use.

Visit Sophie Beauty Salon to experience our luxurious pedicure service and leave feeling relaxed and rejuvenated with beautiful, healthy feet.
